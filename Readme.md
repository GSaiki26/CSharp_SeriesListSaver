# Movies/Series List Guard saver  
Using C# and the SQLite library, I did a program that can save things you add, like movies you watched or animes. If you want to use that, download the folder bin/Release, if the program not open, that's because the SQLite library, I don't have a solution to solve that yet :( . So try to execute the bin/Release1, at there, I put all files the Visual Studio Community create!  
- [ ] Use the SQL from visual studio (without use the SQLite)  
- [ ] Do a better code!  
- [ ] Translate to English (It's in Portuguese)
